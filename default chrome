# set chrome as default
Here's how you can check your current configuration and see what options you have (the names you should use might vary depending on your system):

gio mime x-scheme-handler/http
Then, you can change the default adding the option you want as an extra argument (you probably need to set both http and https):

gio mime x-scheme-handler/http *chrome
gio mime x-scheme-handler/https *chrome

xdg-settings get default-web-browser *chrome
xdg-settings set default-web-browser *chrome
